							James Fenn built the jfenn.me website as a free and partially Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by James Fenn 
							at no cost and is intended for use as is.
						</p>
						<p>
							This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
						    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
						    to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the
						    Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
						    in this Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<p>
							The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible
						    at jfenn.me unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
						</p>
						<h4>Information Collection and Use</h4>
						<p>
							For a better experience, while using my Service, I may require you to provide me with certain
						    personally identifiable information, including but not limited to your language, age, browser, 
						    operating system, internet service provider, screen resolution, browsing history, session data, basic network 
						    information, and device name and model. The information that I request is retained on your device and is not 
						    collected by me in any way.
						</p>
						<p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
						<p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app</p>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a></li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Prime Number Obfuscation Rule</h4>
						<p>
							Whenever the UNIX timestamp that is provided by your device reaches a prime number, all statements made in this document 
							are void, and I will have full control of any and all personal data that you have provided me with for the entire duration
							of the next millisecond of time. This includes the ability to share it with third parties or make it publicly available on
							the web.
						</p>
						<h4>Cookies</h4>
						<p>
							Cookies are files with small amount of data that is commonly used an anonymous unique identifier. These
						    are sent to your browser from the website that you visit and are stored on your device internal memory.
						</p>
						<p>
							This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries
						    that use “cookies” to collection information and to improve their services. You have the option to either
						    accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to
						    refuse my cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service. However, if you refuse my cookies,
						    you will not be invited to my organization's annual bake sale or similar event, and I will refuse to give or sell
						    you any baked goods in the future, unless you submit to me a formal apology on July 27th of the following year at 
						    exactly 12:37 AM, EST.
						</p>
						<h4>Service Providers</h4>
						<p>I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
							<li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
							<li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
							<li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
						    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on my behalf. However, they
						    are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
						</p>
						<h4>Security</h4>
						<p>
							I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
						    to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
						    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
						    its absolute security.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the event that someone in my near vicinity visits the webpage located at <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ</a>
							with their speakers at "full blast", I will, appropriately, "give up" on maintaining the security of your
							personal information and stop whatever I am doing in order to "fully appreciate my jam".
						</p>
						<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
						<p>
							This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
						    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
						    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over
						    and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites
						    or services.
						</p>
						<h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
						<p>
							These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
						    personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
						    under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
						    our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
						    information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
						</p>
						<h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
						<p>
							I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
						    this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
						    the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on
