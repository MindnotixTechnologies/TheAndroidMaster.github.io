Why I like android the best and think apple sucks.^
So, this is a very contraversial topic throughout social media. Which is better, android or apple? The thing is, neither are actually very good. Apple has their simplicity, though their new CEO has dragged the company into bugs, security flaws, and tax evasions. Google has their endless bugs and lagginess, though they have recently eradicated nearly all of them.
